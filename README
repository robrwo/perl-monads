NAME
    Monad::Maybe - A quasi-implementation of the Maybe monad in Perl

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
      use Maybe::Monad;

      *suc = sub { Just(1 + shift) };

      $a = Just(10);

      $x->bind(\&suc);   # returns Just(11);

      *div = lift(sub { $_[0] / $_[1] });

      *add = lift(sub { $_[0] + $_[1] });

      $b = Just(0);

      $c = div($a, $b);  # $c is Nothing

      $d = add($c, $a);  # $d is Nothing

DESCRIPTION
    This is an experimental Perl implementation of a class with some
    properties of the Maybe monad.

  Methods
    nothing
          $x = Monad::Maybe->nothing;

        A constructor that returns "nothing".

    is_nothing
          if ($x->is_nothing) { ... }

        Returns true if the object is "nothing".

    just
          $x = Monad::Maybe->just( $scalar );

        A constructor that sets the value of the monad to "just" the
        argument.

        Note that

          Monad::Maybe->just( undef )

        returns "nothing".

    is_just
          if ($x->is_just) { ... }

        Returns true if the object is not "nothing".

    bind
          $x->bind( $f );

        Applies a function to the value of `$x', where `$f' is a function
        that takes a non-monad as an argument and returns a `Monad::Maybe'
        value.

        If the function does not return a `Monad::Maybe' object, or it
        returns an error, then it will return "nothing".

        If `$x' is nothing, then the `$f' is not actually run, and `bind'
        returns "nothing".

    join
          $x->join;

        Takes a `Monad::Maybe' of a `Monad::Maybe' and returns a
        `Monad::Maybe'.

        If `$x' is not a `Monad::Maybe' of a `Monad::Maybe', then it returns
        "nothing".

  Subroutines
    Nothing
          $x = Nothing;

        Shorthand for the nothing constructor.

    Just
          $x = Just( $v );

        Shorthand for the just constructor.

    lift
          $g = lift( $f );

        Lifts a non-monadic function to a `Monad::Maybe' function.

        If any of the values passed to the lifted function are "nothing",
        then `$f' is not actually executed, and `$g' returns "nothing".

        If `$f' dies, then `$g' returns "nothing".

CAVEATS
    This is an experimental module. The interface may change completely.
